# Hue Lights
The Hue light system is an early example of the IOT boom industry. It controls, brightness, color, and on / off states which can be quickly configured by a simple RESTful API that can be configured to do a number of things. 

## Purpose: 
The following package has been an internal test I've been using for:

1. Easy way to switch my lights off when working in the IDE 
2. Notify myself when a larger model has completed to run
